This directory contains the backend code for the IntelliFeed project, a personalized newsfeed application. It utilizes Node.js with Express.js to provide a robust and scalable API foundation.

### Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- MongoDB instance running locally or on a cloud platform.
- Clone this project repository using Git.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run *npm install* to install all required dependencies.
- Environment Variables:
- Create a .env file in the project root directory (ignore this file with Git).
- Define the following environment variables in the .env file:
- **MONGODB_URI**: The connection string for your MongoDB instance.
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Your API key for Gemini.
- Run *npm start* to start the backend server.
- The server will typically listen on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).

### Project Structure:

- **app.js:** Main application entry point, initializing Express server and middleware.
- **config/:** Configuration files (e.g., database connection, environment variables).
- **controllers/:** Backend logic for API endpoints (e.g., UserController, NewsController).
- **models/:** Mongoose models representing database entities (e.g., User, NewsArticle).
- **routes/:** API routes for user interaction (e.g., /login, /news).
- **services/:** External service interaction logic (e.g., NewsApiService).
- **utils/:** Utility functions used across the backend code.
